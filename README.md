# SharpShooter
SharpShooter (Or Paragon Fake as I renamed it) is a simple shooter-game made with UE4 and C++. The main purpose of the game is to destroy all the enemy AI's by shooting them. This is a beta version of the game, made from the ground up by me during the Unreal Engine C++ Developer: Learn C++ and Make Video Games course on Udemy https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/. The assets that I used to build my map were found on the Unreal Engine Marketplace, and the sound effects I found from sonniss.com. The game uses various mechanics, effects, and blueprints, and I really had a fun time setting up the actors' movements and shooting capabilities, sound effects, and manipulation of the AI! üòÅ
